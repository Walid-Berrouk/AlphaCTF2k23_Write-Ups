## Write-Up

Unfortuatly, there is only few infos i collected for this challenge :

Ifound that the objectif is to get the `poly[0]` to reproduce the sequence of generated bytes, xor them with the flag_enc to get the flag.

The only informations i have about the `poly` are :

 - the sum of the coef (when you enter `1` as input, you get that)
 - Xoring the flag with `b"AlphaCTF{"` can give you first 9 bytes generated from the sequence of random bytes xoed with the flag
